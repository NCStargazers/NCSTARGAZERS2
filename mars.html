    <h1>Mars</h1>
    <h3>Mars is a rocky and dry planet, fourth away from the Sun. In the sky we can see this planet as an illuminated red point. Also known as the "Red Planet" for its oxidizing iron minerals, Mars is currently being analyzed with the Perseverance rover to test for habitability. More discoveries have revealed that Mars' atmosphere is becoming warmer and moister. Mars' days are 24.6 hours in rotation, and its years last 669.6 sols (solar days). Mars's moons are Phobos and Deimos, both spotted with craters.</h3>
