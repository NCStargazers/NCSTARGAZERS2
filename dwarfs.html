   <h1>Dwarf planets</h1>
   <h3>Dwarf planets were defined by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, when Pluto was identified as a dwarf and not a ninth planet. They must have orbit a host star, be roughly round, and be large enough so that it is in its own gravitational orbit around the Sun. Some common dwarf planets within our solar system are: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. </h3>
