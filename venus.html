    <h1>Venus</h1>
    <h3>Second in proximity to the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system (able to melt lead). This is due to its extremely thick atmosphere that traps heat to cause the greenhouse effect. The planet is also surrounded by dense, toxic clouds of sulfuric acid, which smell like rotten eggs.</h3>
    <h3>Venus has a solid surface freckled in volcanoes and mountains, but is also very young (less than 150 million years); its age remains a mystery.</h3>
    <h3>Whilst taking 225 Earth-days to rotate around the sun, its own axis rotation makes one day last 243 Earth-days, longer than the Venusian year.</h3>
