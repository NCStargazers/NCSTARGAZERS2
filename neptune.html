    <h3>Neptune is the eigth planet from the Sun, making its revolution around the Sun about 165 Earth years. It is an ice giant because it has hot, dense fluid made of water, methane, and ammonia, over a rocky core. Neptune has a gassy atmosphere made of hydrogen, atomic helium, and methane, unable to support life. The methane in its atmosphere creates Neptune's well-known blue color because it reflects blue wavelengths while absorbing the red ones. It also has 14 moons and 5 main rings made of dust and debris from its nearby moons. Neptune has only been visited by Voyager 2, but has never been orbited. </h3>
