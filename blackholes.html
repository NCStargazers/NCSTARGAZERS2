    <h1>Black Holes</h1>
    <h3>All matter and radiation fall into black holes. Their gravitational pull is incredibly strong; no light can escape it. Even the speed of light does not have a fast enough escape velocity to exit a black hole's surface (called an "event horizon).</h3> 
    <h3>Black holes are studied by the wrinkles in space-time fabric ("gravitational waves"), but are also detected by studying their light patterns. As tidal forces heat up matter they emit radio and X-ray waves, which may even shoot out as partical jets if near the event horizon.</h3>
    <h3>"Stellar-mass" black holes are dispersed and are at max a few dozen solar masses. They form when a star's core runs out of nuclear fuel and collapse, initiating a supernova explosion and deteriorating the star's exterior layers. "Supermassive monsters" are another type of black hole— more central in galaxies and a hundred thousand to even billions of solar masses— although not much is known about their birth.</h3>
