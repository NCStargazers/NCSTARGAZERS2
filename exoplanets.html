   <h1>Exoplanets</h1>
   <h3>Exoplanets are planets that orbit around stars outside of our solar system. Astronomers detect exoplanets by observing "wobbles" in stars as their planets make elliptical orbits around them. When the exoplanets "transit" (pass infront of the star from the viewer's perspective) they momentarily block out the star's light, helping scientists determine the size of the planet, its distance from its star, and the star's temperature. This information can help us find potential new habitable planets.</h3>
