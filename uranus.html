    <h3>Uranus is the 7th planet in our Sun's orbit with a revolution lasting 84 Earth years. Uranus is an ice giant with hot, dense fluid made of water, methan, and ammonia above a rocky core. Uranus has a gassy atmosphere made of hydrogen, atomic helium, and methane, creating its bluish-green color. Uranus has 27 moons and 13 known rings (its outer ones being colorful). Uranus is unique because it rotates on its side (a vertical axis). </h3>
