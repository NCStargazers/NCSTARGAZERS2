    <h1>Quasars</h1>
    <h3>Quasars are very luminous, over a million solar mass objects in the center of galaxies. Because of their extreme brightness, they can be seen from distant light-years away. They are detected by their high X-ray emissions and "bluer" (hotter than star) appearances.</h3>
    <h3>They are also defined by gas "falling" quickly into black holes and rotating as an "accretion disk" near the event horizon. This process is maintained by the Eddington Limit.</h3>
