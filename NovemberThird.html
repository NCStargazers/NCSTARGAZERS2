   </a>
   <h3>Using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory, astronomers have recently discovered the quickest-growing black hole from early in the universe (1.5 billion years after the Big Bang). Cataloged as LID-568, the black hole has grown over 7 million solar masses in 12 million years. This extreme pace seemingly defies physical limits including the 'super-Eddington accretion' rate. LID-568 was discovered from its bright X-ray emissions and strong gravitational pull of matter. </h3>

   </a>
   <h3>NASA's Parker Solar Probe is ready to finish its 7th and final "flyby" of Venus, allowing it to alter its trajectory and head towards the Sun. This mission began in 2018 and aims to use Venus' gravity to assist the probe in making the closest approach in history to the Sun. The probe will collect data on the Sun's outer atmosphere (corona), but also gives data on venus like its lava flows and heat patterns.</h3>

   </a>
   <h3>China's Shenzhou-18 mission just returned to Earth on November 4th are a 6-month visit to China's Tiangong space station. An astronaut crew collected data on material science, life science, and space techonology after completing over 90 experiments and collecting over 55 categories of samples. Conducting tests usch as exposing microbial sample in space exposure, this mission provides information on the stability of life in space.</h3>
