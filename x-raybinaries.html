   <h1>X-Ray Binaries</h1>
   <h3>X-Ray Binaries are a class of binary stars that emit X-rays. This binary system includes both a normal star and a collapsed star (white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole). Because the pair of stars are very close together, the collapsed star pulls material from the normal star with its intense gravitational pull. This pulled material falls at very high temperatures as X-rays.</h3>
